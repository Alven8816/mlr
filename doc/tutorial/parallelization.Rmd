Parallelization
===============

*R* usually doesn't make use of multiple cores.
With the integration of [parallelMap](https://github.com/berndbischl/parallelMap) into **mlr** it becomes easy to activate the parallel computing already implemented into **mlr**.

```{r}
library("mlr")
library("parallelMap")
parallelStartSocket(2)
task = makeClassifTask(data = iris, target = "Species")
lrn = makeLearner("classif.lda")
rdesc = makeResampleDesc("CV", iters = 4)
r = resample(lrn, task, rdesc)
parallelStop()
```

Under Linux or OSX you might want to use `parallelStartMulticore()` instead.

For further ways of parallelizing the computing consult the [parallelMap tutorial](https://github.com/berndbischl/parallelMap#parallelmap) and help.
